Welcome to Project LEO!
Instructions for writing grammars:
First, in a word doc or similar write your start symbol:
For example:
@ <- start symbol

After every decleration, put an arrow and then what it is
For example:

number <- 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9

In the above example, I included the pipe( | ) or "or" sign.  Use this to represent something that could be one thing or another.

Here is a complete example:

equation <- start symbol

equation <- number + number | number - number | number * number | number / number

number <- 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9

Remeber all instructions MUST end in a terminal.
Have fun!
